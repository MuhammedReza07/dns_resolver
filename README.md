# A simple DNS resolver

The result of extensive (not really) research about the DNS protocol and my attempt to implement the functionality
described in the standards. As the author, I would not recommend using the code provided by this repository for any
"serious" purposes, since it is (and probably will remain) incomplete. Nevertheless, feedback is appreciated.
